## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Using Make (Recommended)
```bash
# Install required tools
make install-tools

# Quick start for development
make quick-start

# Edit configuration
vim dev.tfvars

# Deploy to development
make apply ENV=dev
```

### Manual Deployment
1. **Prerequisites**
   ```bash
   # Install Terraform
   curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   sudo apt-add-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main"
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install terraform
   
   # Configure AWS CLI
   aws configure
   ```

2. **Deploy Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   # Clone and navigate to directory
   cd terraform-odoo-aws
   
   # Copy and customize variables
   cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
   # Edit terraform.tfvars with your values
   
   # Initialize Terraform
   terraform init
   
   # Plan deployment
   terraform plan
   
   # Deploy infrastructure
   terraform apply
   ```

3. **Post-Deployment**
   - Configure Odoo application
